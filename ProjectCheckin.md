### Completed Tasks:
1. Set up the Github for the project: https://github.com/calvindongzw/COEN342GroupProject/ --- Zhiwei Dong
2. Explore what models will be used (BiT and ViT) and merge the original githubs to ours for future using --- Zhiwei Dong
3. Explore dataset availability such as which one should be started with and which one should be followed --- Zhiwei Dong, Yu Ji
4. Explore possible computing resources: HPC, Google Colab, personal devices and so on --- Zhiwei Dong, Yu Ji, Ruofan Lu
